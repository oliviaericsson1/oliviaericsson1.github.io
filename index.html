    <p>My name is Olivia Ericsson, I am third year Data Science and Finance major. I am originally from Stockholm, Sweden but moved to Palo Alto, CA at the age of 7. 
      I recently completed a Finance Co-op at BCG and currently looking for new co-ops for next Fall.
      I am intrigued by the intersection of Finance and Technology and look forward to learning and 
      building new websites in DS 4200.</p>
